## Repository Structure and Access

This repository is organized to ensure full transparency and reproducibility
of the ICU cohort construction and analysis pipeline.

are **not redistributed** in this repository due to size and licensing constraints.

Processed and intermediate data used in the analyses are generated locally
following the procedures described in the documentation.
