# src

This folder contains the source code used for data loading, preprocessing, 
feature engineering, modelling, evaluation, and visualization.

Modularizing the project into Python scripts enhances clarity, reproducibility, and reusability.

## modules

- `data_loading.py` — functions for loading INFLUD datasets from `data/raw/`
- `preprocessing.py` — cleaning, imputation, transformations
- `visualization.py` — utilities for generating figures for manuscripts and supplementary material

Additional scripts may be added as the project evolves
