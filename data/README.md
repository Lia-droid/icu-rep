# Data Directory

This folder stores the **local copies** of the INFLUD (SRAG) datasets used for cohort construction and modeling.  
Due to size constraints and licensing policy, the raw CSV files **are not included** in the public repository.

## 🔹 Required dataset: INFLUD 2021

To reproduce the analyses, download the official SRAG/INFLUD dataset from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (OpenDataSUS):

Dataset page: https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/srag-2021-a-2024  
Resource used: **“2021 – Banco congelado (26/06/2025) – CSV”**

After downloading, rename the file to:

```
INFLUD2021.csv
```

And place it inside:

```
data/raw/INFLUD2021.csv
```

## 🔹 Directory structure

```
data/
   raw/              ← place INFLUD CSV files here
   processed/        ← cleaned and prepared datasets generated by scripts
```

Scripts in the repository expect the following path:

```python
pd.read_csv("data/raw/INFLUD2021.csv", sep=";")
```

## 🔹 License Note

The dataset is publicly released by the Brazilian Ministry of Health under the OpenDataSUS terms of use.
